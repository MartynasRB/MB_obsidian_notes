1. ~~Research Questions - looks complete, re-read one more time just in case. Fix formatting.~~
2. ~~Literature Review - looks complete, re-read one more time. Fix formatting. FIX THE REFERENCES!!~~
3. ~~Study Area - looks relatively complete, fix formatting. If there are problems, we can re-do the map, or make an additional map too. Ignore the map for now.~~
4. ~~Data - looks relatively complete, but needs additional re-reading and possible fixing. Formatting too!~~ 
5. ~~Methods - looks almost complete, but check the info altogether.~~

After all these five checks are complete:

1. ~~Export as PDF (correct dates!) and submit (comment regarding additional paragraphs not related to the actual submission!).~~
2. ~~Once everything besides the study area doc are ready for submission, check time.~~
    1. ~~If there's time to ~12 pm, try re-doing the map.~~
    2. ~~If there's little time, submit as it is.~~
5. ~~Spend time reading literature.~~

> For tomorrow:
> 
> We will be waiting for the plan parts grading until Fri, so we have time to prepare.
> 1. Create a project plan document and construct the structure. DO NOT put the assignment text yet until it is approved (less work that way).
> 2. Write an introduction as it is needed anyway.
> 3. If there's plenty of time after that, start restructuring the penguin MS
