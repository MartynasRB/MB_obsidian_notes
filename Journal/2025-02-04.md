We will be waiting for the plan parts grading until Fri, so we have time to prepare.

1. ~~Create a project plan document and construct the structure.~~ ~~DO NOT put the assignment text yet until it is approved (less work that way).~~
2. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Write an introduction as it is needed anyway.</mark> Opted not to because we might have to re-do the lit review after it is graded, and part of the lit review could become an intro section. Let us wait before we create useless jobs for ourselves.
3. ~~Write the introduction section of the penguin MS~~
