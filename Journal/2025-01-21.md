Previously on *Thesis*:

Read about Burst InSAR, might be a solution but we would need to do merging, which can be restrictive. We will have to look 

**End of day:**

Look how our AoI looks in Burst InSAR - does it cover multiple bursts? Will we need merging?

Finished reading Hanssen, big book. Take all the notes to the thought board. Then begin downloading all project plan references, categorizing them and starting to read them (maybe do a few just to start?)
