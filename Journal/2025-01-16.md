Continuing reading the book... Today from p. 147 to 210.
Finished at p. 188. This is ridiculous...


We will have to re-do our test with a much smaller image subset, and for that we will follow the below workflow:
1. Determine if ingrams cover the AoI.
2. Determine the rectangular corner coordinates of the AoI.
3. Place extracted raw (unclipped) Hyp3 data in a new folder, in the required folder structure.
4. Use the GDAL clipping functions in the code to clip all ingrams to the AoI.
5. Run SBAS processing, but maybe do it stepwise and look at the results (we can follow a similar logic as in the tutorial workflow.)
