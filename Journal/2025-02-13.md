LB received permission from AÄŒ to send data, AB preparing data package and it will be ready "next week". 

Restructured thesis folders so it is all very neat and tidy now.

1. ~~Contact the student responsible for the Lund meetup and ask for details, and possibility to present work.~~
2. Add the notes from the literature that was read yesterday.
3. It seems we have 10 datasets to gather. Prepare a new folder system to hold gathered data.
4. Carefully download at least 4 datasets and document thoroughly - ensure that we know the specifications and parameters, ensure that we download any and all metadata that can be found, if space and time allows, download AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE data.
5. Keep an up-to-date specs table for each dataset that we can later use as a table in the results.
6. Consider contacting David regarding the time period for defense. It is now known that it should be during the semester which means not around June 25 - Aug 15. (POSTPONED TO MAYBE NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER THAT!)
