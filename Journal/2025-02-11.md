> [!NOTE]
> For tomorrow:
> 
> 1. Consider contacting David regarding the time period for defense. It is now known that it should be during the semester which means not around June 25 - Aug 15. (POSTPONED TO MAYBE NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER THAT!)
> 2. Contact the student responsible for the Lund meetup and ask for details, and possibility to present work.
> 3. Read literature. We should aim to read 4 articles every literature day, at the LEAST!!
