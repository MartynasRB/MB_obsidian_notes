Start by really diving deep into Methods:

1. ~~Re-read the text. Does it sound cohesive?~~
2. ~~Re-read the requirements. Do we fit them?~~
3. ~~If both yes, then create the workflow chart.~~

~~REMOVE RVI in flowchart and methdology, replace it with study information.~~


Create the study area document:

1. Create the map.
2. Do we meet requirements?

For Monday morning:

1. Describe data in Data documents - check requirements!!
2. Check the previous documents to see if they are cohesive, readable and fit requirements.
3. Final touches and send.

> [!NOTE]
> For tomorrow:
> 
> Research Qs and Lit Review are ready, Methods doc is fixed and ready, Data doc is prepared but might need some small changes.
> 
> 1. Describe in text the study area, use placenames but keep in mind that all placenames must be referred in the map.
> 2. Add the Study Period paragraph below the text.
> 3. Create a simple map, use the placenames.
