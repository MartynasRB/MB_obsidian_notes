<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">We don't have Pysolid, maybe install that?</mark> need to install insarlab/PySolid

Everything went well with the large complete workflow tutorial.

Now we will do the following - the small Hyp3 data example at ([Example datasets - MintPy](https://mintpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo_dataset/)), then the large Hyp3 integration using our own data, which might require a re-download. This will follow the structure from here ([Example directory structure - MintPy](https://mintpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dir_structure/#hyp3)), preparation of the ifgram stack from here ([hyp3-docs/docs/tutorials/hyp3\_insar\_stack\_for\_ts\_analysis.ipynb at develop · ASFHyP3/hyp3-docs · GitHub](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-docs/blob/develop/docs/tutorials/hyp3_insar_stack_for_ts_analysis.ipynb)), and other general guidance from here ([GitHub - ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab\_MintPy\_Recipe\_Book: A Jupyter-Book containing data recipes for creating HyP3 Sentinel-1 IINSAR\_GAMMA and INSAR\_ISCE\_BURST Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) Time Series Analyses with MintPy](https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab_MintPy_Recipe_Book?tab=readme-ov-file)).

**Big test with Curonian data:**
1. Before, we downloaded some InSAR data processed with Hyp3, the data was placed in a folder as .zip files.
2. Unpack the data: 
```
cwd ='D:/Mokslas/Thesis/test-data/code/curonian_test_files'
for path, directories, files in os.walk(cwd):
    for f in files:
        if f.endswith(".zip"):
            zip_pack = os.path.join(path, f)
            with ZipFile(zip_pack,"r") as zip_ref:
                print("Extracting: " + f)
                zip_ref.extractall(cwd)
                print("Completed extraction of: " + f)
```
3.  Code being written to `curonian_test.py`

Test successful, but we are idiots and we chose a wrong area. Next time, let us choose a more fitting area. 

But overall the process is successful and generates results as expected.
