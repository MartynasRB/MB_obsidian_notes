Beginning large test with full tutorial datasets.

MintPy OpenSARLab tutorial failed because it is made for Linux, many errors to fix. Temporarily postponed.

Going to do a few more default datasets from the MintPy documentation, and then begin with my own test data.

Also, everything happens in the `thesis` environment which has mintpy installed.

Again, initial test with the ISCE2 example dataset, to preview the entire workflow:

```
cd D:\Mokslas\Thesis\test-data\code\FernandinaSenDT128\mintpy
smallbaselineApp.py FernandinaSenDT128.txt
```

Everything seems successful. One more tutorial using data prepared with a different processor:

Running a Gamma Wells example dataset returns an error, likely from no CDS account connection.

**The following is a workflow to connect CDS to Python:**

```
conda install cdsapi
```

Create a .cdsapirc file in User folder - this is basically a file with an API private token to login to CDS services for download.

Ran a short test download to check if CDS API call works:

```
import cdsapi

cds = cdsapi.Client()

cds.retrieve('reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels', {

           "variable": "temperature",

           "pressure_level": "1000",

           "product_type": "reanalysis",

           "date": "2017-12-01/2017-12-31",

           "time": "12:00",

           "format": "grib"

       }, 'download.grib')
```

**Returning back to GAMMA example dataset to see if it works now:**

```
cd D:\Mokslas\Thesis\test-data\code\WellsEnvD2T399\mintpy
smallbaselineApp.py WellsEnvD2T399.txt
```

Looks okay, but we need to try a few output modes. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">This is currently shelved until we execute more sophisticated combined tutorials.</mark>

**Sophisticated tutorial ARIA + MintPy (Sentinel-1 on San Francisco Bay, California):**

This is from [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/insarlab/MintPy-tutorial/blob/main/workflows/smallbaselineApp_aria.ipynb)

```
pip install python-utils
```

Download stage is done separately by using the https download link, to avoid using idiotic shell commands within the code cells that do not execute without additional installed packages from the VSCode Python shell.

The entire SBAS processing can be run by a single command, while the configuration settings are set by the "template file" `SmallbaselineApp.cfg`.  Essentially, this tutorial workflow runs through all the individual steps and settings to get one familiar with MintPy and the template. 

`egrep`<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> shell command is not recognized, maybe later on we need to install it?</mark>

Question: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Why we invert a network of small baseline interferograms to estimate a single reference time-series, instead of forming the single-reference network of interferograms at first place?</mark> Find answer in notes.

Resume tomorrow from the beginning of Section 3 (Error analysis) in the tutorial.
