1. ~~Annotated Research Questions:~~
	1. ~~What local conditions makes impact on the temporal baseline?~~
	2. ~~I still feel a bit uncertain, is the project running on seasonal dynamics, or annual dynamics? Temporal decorrelation can be seasonal/annual. Height estimations are continuous.~~
	3. ~~ERA5 vs MODIS: Perhaps use the boundary layer height and Total column water of ERA5.~~ 
2. Annotated Data:
	1. ~~Do you know when you can get the ground survey data?Â It is a pretty important part of the project, so it seems necessary to get it as soon as possible.~~
3. Project Plan remarks
	1. Look at the *Remarks* document, and refer to the questions highlighted in RED:
		1. ~~Separation of temperature and freeze-thaw.~~
		2. ~~Using relative humidity products from ERA5-land instead of MODIS.~~
		3. ~~Maps of the area providing vegetation cover.~~
		4. ~~Water vapor measurements - relative humidity at ground level vs precipitable water content along the integrable signal path.~~
		5. ~~Surface soil moisture data from SAR backscatter.~~
		6. ~~Testing precipitable water vapor vs relative humidity.~~
		7. ~~Validation data - maybe touch upon problems regarding how the data is YET to be delivered. Maybe mention what can be used instead if *for some reason* it is not delivered.~~
		8. ~~Vegetation influence on changes - forested vs sparse grass.~~
		9. ~~PS vs DS InSAR - why the region cannot be "simply enlarged" to have persistent scatterers.~~
4. ~~Lund Meet-up in March~~
	1. ~~Student-teacher presentations?~~
	2. ~~Any other knowledge?~~
5. ~~Time plan~~
	1. ~~Maybe present my own version of what a time plan could look like.~~
6. ~~Home consulting/supervision~~
	1. ~~Do I even need this?~~
	2. ~~Requirement?~~
7. ~~Submission schedule~~
	1. ~~His ideas, how it fits into the time plan~~
8. **DEFENSE DATE** and possibility to defend live.
9. Complete project plan submission
	1. Do I need to add an intro section?
	2. Anything else to add besides what is in the prev 5 submissions?
		1. Time plan?
		2. Home supervision?
		3. Anything else?
